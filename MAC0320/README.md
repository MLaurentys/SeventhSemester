  # Introduction to Graph Theory - MAC0320
  ### Summary
  I consider that I learned four important lessons in this class. 
  1. I learned basic vocabulary 
  2. I learned techniques to solver graph theory problems 
  3. I learned how to translate some general problems to graph problems 
  4. I learned several important algorithms 

  ###  Observations
  1. All the exercises linked have been solved as homework 
  2. All the exercises are in Portuguese (and I don't think I will translate them)
