# Introduction to Graph Theory - MAC0320
### Summary
I consider that I learned four important lessons in this class. 
1. I learned basic vocabulary 
2. I learned techniques to solver graph theory problems 
3. I learned how to translate some general problems to graph problems 
4. I learned several important algorithms 

###  Observations
1. All the exercises linked have been solved as homework 
2. All the exercises are in Portuguese (and I don't think I will translate them) 

### Topics 
The topic number roughly matches the exercise list number (ordered according to classes) 
1. Concepts and basic results
2. Eulerian Graphs
3. Trees
4. Hamiltonian Graphs
5. Matchings 
6. Edge Coloring 
7. Vertex Coloring 
8. Planar Graphs
9. Connectivity and Menger Theorem
