# Seventh Semester
### Classes
This semester I took 7 classes:
- FLC0474 - Portuguese Language
- MAC0102 - Paths in the Bachelor of Computer Science
- MAC0209 - Modeling and Simulation
- MAC0320 - Introduction to Graph Theory
- MAC0323 - Algorithms and Data Structures II
- MAE0221 - Probability I
- MAT0236 - Differentiable functions and series

### Overview
I think I developed my programming/algorithmic skills the most this semester. MAC0323 was a strong course with several small programming exercises that both thought me new areas/problems and improved my pre-existing knowledge in almost every programming challenge.

Regarding mathematics, I also made a big leap in calculus by improving series/sequences calculations/understanding. Another big leap was developing this new concept (for me) that is graph theory. I now feel comfortable solving and modeling graph problems.

Probability was a nice recap of statistics but included many more deeper calculations and subjects. I am definitely better in combinatorics now.
