# Paths in the Bachelor of Computer Science - MAC0102
### Summary
This class is composed of a set of non-sequential lectures about various areas of Computer Science and different paths you can take while graduating in the field. The lectures intend to show the various challenges of the field and help students choose an area to focus.

###  Observations
* Other than participating in the lecture, I only made reviews (that will not be pushed) during the class.

### Featured
Some topics of the lectures I really enjoyed:
- Combinatorics Programming
- Quantum Computing
- Non-linear Programming
- Computer Vision
